# Geomagnetic-Storm-Temp-Correlation

Created to run in a Jupyter Notebook using Anaconda for Python.

Required modules include
    matplotlib
    numpy as np
    json
    requests
    datetime

Python class final project for the semester.

Created as part of a demonstration of the learned material, the intent of this programming project is to explore the hypothesis that geomagnetic-storm induced disturbences to the Earth's magnetosphere noteably influence the temperature over a certain period.

My findings were inconclusive for several reasons namely my lack of knowledge on climatology.

Feel free to have a play around with it!
